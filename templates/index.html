            <p>With each moment spent together, I found myself falling deeper. Your laughter became my favorite melody, your smile my guiding light. Remember our first kiss? It felt like the wierdest thing you have ever done. Though I cant say the same thing for nowadays.</p>

            <p>It's not just the grand gestures, but the small moments that make our love extraordinary:</p>
            <ul class="memory-list">
                <li>The way you slowly but surely became comfortable with me</li>
                <li>Our silly dance arguments on who didn't say night to the other</li>
                <li>How you always know when I need a hug</li>
                <li>Our late-night conversations about everything and nothing</li>
                <li>The unique handshake we invented</li>
                <li>The comfort of your cuddles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These little things are the threads that weave the beautiful tapestry of our love.</p>

            <p>Life with you is an endless adventure. But this is a section we never go to do</p>
            <p>This I hoped we would have done:</p>
            <ul class="memory-list">
                <li>Got on a date</li>
                <li>Stayed up all night to watch a bunch of seriers</li>
                <li>Attempted to compete in a cooking competion</li>
                <li>Take a shower together and see how it goes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Can't be mad on what we didn't do, just grateful for what we did.</p>
